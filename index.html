  <p><strong>Okay, maybe I'm lying.&nbsp;</strong><em>Half-lying?</em> I consider <em>esports (electronic sports)&nbsp;</em>a sport, and <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/is-esports-a-sport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of others do too</a>, so esports is a sport.</p>

  <td style="width: 1000px;">
  <p>I used to think that esports could never work out for me, but although I wasn't bad, I wasn't great, especially not great enough to make minor league teams, let alone major league teams. Nowadays, <a href="what_i_play.html">I play a number of games</a> with some friends that can bring out the best performance in me, like how a good NBA, NHL, or NFL team, to name a few, brings out the best in each player.</p>

  <tr>
  <td style="width: 1000px;">
  <p>Although I don't think I'll ever be amazing enough to compete in any league tournaments or be cast on big screens, I still enjoy playing with a good team and running local tournaments. Even though we might not be the best at it, at the end of the day, it's not about winning the money or prizes or beating the other team or whatever, it's about having fun and playing something you enjoy, and as clich&eacute; as that sounds, it's true, and <a href="why_i_play.html">that's why I play!</a></p>
