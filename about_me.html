        <p>Let's be real, you probably don't care who I am. That's fair, I probably wouldn't be the most ecstatic

        <p>If you had seen the video clip, you'd know that I go by&nbsp;<em>senji </em>or<em> kaiz</em>. Obviously, if
          you saw me in class or in the halls, there is no chance you're going to go out of your way and call me either
          of those names, so you can call me Philip, or Phil, whichever one you prefer.</p>

        <p>I'd like to think that I have a long long history in video games and esports. I first got into games when I
          was in grade 6 in 2014, Counter-Strike <a href="what_i_play.html"><em>(as you would've seen)</em></a> was my
          competitive game. Immediately I wanted to get all of my friends on it and get a cool little team or clan
          going.</p>
        <p>I wasn't really able to however because most other people were still playing Minecraft or ROBLOX or whatnot
          so I ended up solo queuing, which as the name suggests, queuing into a game by yourself along with 4 other
          random players.</p>
        <p>You thought I was kidding about not having friends huh? No, I seriously had no friends who played what I
          played for a very long time. A lot of these games I picked up at the time like Counter-Strike, Rocket League,
          Rainbow Six: Siege, none of my friends played when I played, and vice versa.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 1000px;">
        <p>Yeah, you thought I'd get into my actual life and write a little autobiography about myself? Nah, none of you
          really care too much anyway, but in case you did want to be a friend, you'll find my socials here, or at least
          the ones I'm comfortable providing.</p>
